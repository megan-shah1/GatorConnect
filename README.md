# About GatorConnect
Gator Connect is designed to help incoming students at the University of Floria find friends based on shared interests 
and mutual connections. The summer before freshman year can be a stressful time for many students and this application aims to
ease the transition by creating a platform where students can connect and interact with one another.

This project was coded in C++ and leverages the power of graphs and Depth-First and Breadth-First searches to generate a list of common
friends and their interests. Students will be able to access common friends' social medias and connect with them before starting
classes at the University of Florida.
